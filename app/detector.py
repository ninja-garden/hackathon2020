            Converts some image to list of tuples of five floats, which
            represent some building on image.
            Floats #1-4 contain x1,y1,x2,y2 in this particular order,
            where x1,y1 - coordinate of left bottom vertice of rectangle,
            x2,y2 - coordinate of right upper vertice of rectangle.
            All coordinates are given in pixel space.
            Point (0,0) is upper left corner of image.
            Float #5 is the angle (in case the rectangle is rotated somehow).
